<p>AVIT 260 is the only class I'm taking this semester that is directly related to my major Air Traffic Management. 
The content of the course involves learning how to give aircraft proper "IFR Clearance", which gives the pilots confirmation or any changed information they have gotten for their flight plan.
It also involves learning how to properly direct aircraft to their designated runways and parking areas.
There is other content in the course we have yet to go over, but I'm still excited to see what it will be.</p>

<p id="ab">Below is a diagram of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The thin, straight, black lines are the airport runways used for takeoff and landing. 
The thin, gray lines with black lettering over them are the airport taxiways used by aircraft and airport vehicles to navigate throughout the airport.
The other oddly-shaped black objects are airport buildings. 
The buildings closest to the tower (TWR 389) are the main airport terminals (where most commercial aircraft will park), with the rest being labeled accordingly.</p>

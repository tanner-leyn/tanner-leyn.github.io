<h2>Drumming</h2>

<p>I've known how to play the drums since elementary school. 
I don't play that much nowadays since I have neither the time nor equipment.
I played in the school band for a little bit, but I eventually left since my interest started to waver.
I still enjoy drumming, just not in the setting of a large marching band.
My favorite drummers would probably be Chris Turner (from Oceans Ate Alaska), Neil Peart, who is pictured above (from Rush), and Donovan Melero (from Hail the Sun). 
I wouldn't say I'm nearly as capable of playing on their skill level, but a lot of their parts on songs are somewhat engraved into my mind, which makes it hard not to start tapping my foot and using my fingers to play along.</p>

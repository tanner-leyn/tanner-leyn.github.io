<p>Although I didn't know what I wanted to become for most of my life, I've decided that I want to become an Air Traffic Controller. 
What I did know was that I was interested in helping people, whether it was directly or indirectly, and I had an interest in aircraft. 
The first thing that came to mind was a pilot, but I wasn't (and still mostly am not) a fan of traveling constantly. 
What I wanted was a job with a set time that also allowed me to go home every night. 
Although it sounds like a weird reason, it's something I felt was necessary.
Then I thought about Air Traffic Control, which still dealt with aircraft, helped people, and didn't involve traveling.
I looked into it, became extremely interested, and eventually looked for universities with good programs and found UND.</p>
<br />
<p id="abc">To most, this job sounds stressful (I'm reminded of that almost anytime I mention my career path to anyone), but I do feel confident that I could work in the environment without letting the stress get to me.
When put in stressful situations, I only ever feel the pressure if someone feels the need to let me know in the moment.
I'm usually too focused on completing the task correctly so I won't have to take more time to fix it.
The entire goal is to help the pilots and passengers get to their destination as quick as possible and in the safest manner, and I believe I can keep a cool head and focus on accomplishing that before I begin thinking about making a mistake.</p>

<p>I listen to most genres of music, but my favorites are rock/metal, electronic, and hip-hop. 
I usually stay away from foreign music, since I can't really understand any non-English lyrics, but sometimes I'll find stuff I like. </p>

<p id="abcd">I'd say the most interesting genre I've found would be Scandinavian Metal.
My least favorite genre would have to be pop music since a lot of it just feels boring and uninspired.
I do like instrumentals a lot and consider them to be a good form of music, despite the many who may disagree.</p>
